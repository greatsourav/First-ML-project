prediting frauds in banking system using SOM

The bank had issued credit cards to its customers in past few years and the issuance was based on credit scores, applications etc.

There are chances that some fraudulent applications got approved (due to human error or something). We have to find some possible frauds so that they can be further investigated by the bank, thus saving the bank from possible losses in the future.

For this, we are using Machine learning, Deep learning concepts & data from the Credit_Card_Applications.csv  file.
